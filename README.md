**Note**: these dotfiles are for the [fish shell][fish] only.
These configurations are designed to work out-of-the-box on both MacOS and Arch
Linux, but can be easily adapted to other distributions.

## Installation

I use a simple tool called [yadm][yadm] to manage my dotfiles, but it's not
required! However if you're interested in using yadm it's as simple as:

```sh
yadm clone https://github.com/sijan2/dotfiles.git
yadm status
yadm bootstrap
```

Otherwise you can copy over individual files and directories as needed.
